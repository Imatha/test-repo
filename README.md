What is the use of Readme file and gitignore

README file:

The README file typically contains information about the project, including its purpose, how to install and use it, any dependencies, configuration instructions, and other relevant details.

gitignore file:

The .gitignore file specifies intentionally untracked files that Git should ignore. These files are often temporary or generated by the build process and don't belong in the repository.
